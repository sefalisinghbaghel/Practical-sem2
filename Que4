Using Titanic dataset, do the following

a. Find total number of passengers with age less than 30

b. Find total fare paid by passengers of first class

c. Compare number of survivors of each passenger class




ans:
(a) import pandas as pd

# Assuming you have loaded the Titanic dataset into a DataFrame called 'titanic_data'
# Replace 'titanic_data.csv' with the path to your dataset file
titanic_data = pd.read_csv('titanic_data.csv')

# Filter passengers with age less than 30
passengers_under_30 = titanic_data[titanic_data['Age'] < 30]

# Count the total number of passengers with age less than 30
total_passengers_under_30 = passengers_under_30.shape[0]

print("Total number of passengers with age less than 30:", total_passengers_under_30)



(b) # Filter passengers belonging to the first class
first_class_passengers = titanic_data[titanic_data['Pclass'] == 1]

# Calculate the total fare paid by first class passengers
total_fare_first_class = first_class_passengers['Fare'].sum()

print("Total fare paid by passengers of first class:", total_fare_first_class)


(c) # Group the dataset by passenger class and sum up the survivors
survivors_by_class = titanic_data.groupby('Pclass')['Survived'].sum()

print("Number of survivors of each passenger class:")
print(survivors_by_class)
